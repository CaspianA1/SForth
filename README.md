# SForth: a small Forth interpreter.

## Builtin words:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- equality, greater-than, gte, less than, lte
- Dup, drop, swap, over, rot
- Output via emit, cr, . and ".

## Words that I'd like to add:
- and, or, invert
- if then, mod, if else then, do loop, variable
- !, @, constant, allot, key, begin until

## Update:
- Now, there's also a version of the interpreter included written in Scheme.
- So far, it has support for basic mathematical operations, boolean logic and word definitions.
- Download Chez Scheme to run it if you want to try it out!
